## Experimental confirmation for $\sigma^{\*}$

![](/images/sigma_star.png)

The length of representations $q^{(L)}=K^{(L)}(x,x)$ over layers $L$ is shown for different choices of $\sigma$, the weight noise.

We show that the representation length does not change over layers when $\sigma^{\*}$ is used (red line). For all other choices of $\sigma$, the length exponentially grows or decays (black).
The same observation holds for all choices of $f$.
